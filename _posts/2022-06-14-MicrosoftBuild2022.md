## There is a lot great staff coming, so that take my most interest:

[1.2.1. Azure Container Apps now generally available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-container-apps-general-availability/ba-p/3416885)
Azure Container Apps, now generally available, enables customers to run microservices and containerized apps on a serverless platform. Azure Container Apps is built on the foundation of powerful open-source technology in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

[1.3.5. Azure Synapse Analytics updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-synapse-analytics-blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-azure-synapse-link-for-sql/ba-p/3372986)
Azure Synapse Link for SQL enables near real-time insights by eliminating barriers between operational data stores and Azure Synapse Analytics. Customers can remove data movement barriers and replace manual extract, transform and load (ETL) cycles with more impactful innovation. For both SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Link serves as a seamless data pipeline to Azure Synapse Analytics, so customers do not need to manage ETL logic. This makes it easier to do business intelligence (BI) reporting on operational data in near real-time, without impacting the operational store.

[1.7.1. Microsoft Dev Box and Azure Deployment Environments coming soon](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/introducing-microsoft-dev-box/ba-p/3412063)
Microsoft Dev Box will give developers self-service access to high performance, cloud-based workstations that are preconfigured and ready-to-code for specific projects. Azure Deployment Environments will make it easy for developer teams to quickly spin up app infrastructure with project-based templates that establish consistency and best practices.

[1.7.3. .NET Multi-platform App UI now generally available](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-dotnet-maui-one-codebase-many-platforms/)
.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI), now generally available, is a new framework for building modern, multi-platform, natively compiled apps for iOS, Android, macOS and Windows using C# and XAML in a single codebase. The framework solves the challenges developers face when building native apps across many operating systems. Instead of having to learn multiple technology stacks, .NET MAUI abstracts them into one common framework built on .NET 6

[2.1.1. New additions and updates to the Microsoft Learn portfolio](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/explore-technical-innovations-and-skill-up-at-microsoft-build/ba-p/2800608)
The Microsoft Learn training and certifications portfolio has been enhanced with new and updated training and certifications to offer a wide range of benefits for users, ranging from exam prep to cybersecurity training to data analytics to role-playing real-world tech issues.

[4.1.4. Datamart in Power BI now in preview](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-datamart-in-power-bi/)
Datamart in Power BI, now in preview, is a new Power BI Premium self-service capability that enables users to uncover actionable insights through their own independent and dependent data sets. For the first time ever, Microsoft is empowering everyone with the ability to build datamarts that can be centrally governed and managed for workloads up to a terabyte.

[1.6.1. AZURE BICEP V0.4, AVAILABLE JUNE 2021, WITH NEW FEATURES TO IMPROVE WORKFLOW AND VALIDATE CODE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-azure-capabilities-to-simplify-deployment-and-management/)
Azure Bicep, now available, is an open-source language for declaratively deploying Azure resources as code that simplifies the authoring experience. It provides concise syntax, better support for code reuse and improved type safety. Azure Bicep v0.4 features make it possible to easily maintain code bases with the new bicep linter, simplify code structures and validate code to reduce errors.
